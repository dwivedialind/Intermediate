# Binary Tree  

Why you want to use a tree? Advantages of two other structures: `an ordered array and linked list.`  
Search a tree quickly as in ordered array, and also insert and delete items quickly as in Linked List.  

## Slow Insertion in an Ordered Array

In ordered Array, Binary Search in O(logN).  
While Inserting includes find right position to insert and move elements.  
Similary Deleting involves the same multimove operations and is thus equally slow.
