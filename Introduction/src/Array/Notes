#Binary Search: prerequesite: ordered arrays, much faster than linear array especially for larger arrays.
#Ordered Arrays are useful in situation when searches are frequent but insertion and deletion are not.

#In a real situation, the actual time (in microseconds or whatever) required by the
 insertion is related to the speed of the microprocessor, how efficiently the compiler
 has generated the program code, and other factors

#Arrays in Java are object created with the new operator.
#Unordered arrays offer fast insertion[O(1)] but slow searching[O(N)] and deletion[O(N)].
#A class interface is composed of the methods (and ocassionally fields) that the class user can access.

#Linear search: O(N)
#Binary search: O(logN)
