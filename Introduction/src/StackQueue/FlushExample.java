/*
In the context of output streams, buffering refers to the temporary data storage before itâ€™s written out.
Once this buffer reaches its capacity or is explicitly flushed, the accumulated data is written out in a single go.
However, this buffering mechanism can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.
 Data might not appear immediately where expected, leading to potential confusion.

        // Flush the output buffer to ensure "world!" is immediately written to the console
        //When invoked, the flush() method ensures that any buffered data in the stream is immediately written out:
        System.out.flush();

        // Rest of the program
    }
