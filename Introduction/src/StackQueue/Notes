#Stack-Queue-Priority Queue
1. These data structures are programmers tools. They're primarily conceptual aids rather than full-fledged data storage devices.
2. Have restricted access. The interface of these structures is designed ot enforce this restricted access.
3. More abstract entities than many other data storage structures.

4.Most microprocessors use a stack-based architecture. When a method is called, its
  return address and arguments are pushed onto a stack, and when it returns, theyâ€™re
  popped off. The stack operations are built into the microprocessor.
5. Can be implemented using arrays or LL, however interface have only three methods allowed push() at top, pop() at top, peek() at top.
